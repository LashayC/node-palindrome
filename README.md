## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

To begin building this, everything was programmed on the front end. Once the checker was working, I moved the checking functionality to the server.js. To reverse the word I took the input as a string and used the methods of split, reverse, and join. The new word was then compared against the original.


## Lessons Learned:

Something breaking is not the end of the world. This is one of my first node.js projects so it was an adjustment getting to know the terminal and all the pretty new error messages. I was initially slower with this as I worried about throwing things off balance but after the first fiew breaks, I leaned in and had fun getting the checker to work.
